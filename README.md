Spike Plan
==============

**Name**: "Alex Sonneveld <alex.sonneveld@live.com.au>"

## Context:
"Hello World" is a simple program to test that the computer can run code.

**Knowledge/Skill/Technology Gap:**
The developer is not aware or familiar with Rust and needs to setup their
workstation to compile code written in Rust for their future self-projects or
external projects.

## Goals/Deliverables:
**[GIT REPOSITORY (CODE)] + [SPIKE REPORT]**
- You need to create a simple "Hello World" application in Rust
- It needs to compile
- It should display the text "Hello World" to the screen, when executed.
  (The executable can be committed along side the source code, but even if it is
  not you need to detail how to compile said program so that the reviewer can
  compile it on their machine)

This program should be the absolute minimum needed to write a program in Rust.

You need will need upload your copy of this Git repository, your with code and
your Spike Report that describes the steps involved to setup your machine
(and/or potentially other remote machines) to run your Rust code.

Your reports should be in Markdown (or similar text format), so that the can be
reviewed within the browser, or opened with the default text editor installed on
the operating system (please NO Microsoft Word documents).

**Planned start date:**  2017/03/06

**Deadline:**  2017/03/15

## Planning notes:
- Review the Goals/Deliverables (above)
- Review the recommended sources (below)
- Read the _online_ documentation for Rust
- Commit your work to Git
- Upload your finished report (in Markdown preferred) and provide a link

**Extras / Bonus Points:**

- What bugs did you encounter?
- Can you execute the compiled (or interpreted) program on another machine, if
  not why?
- Who and why did they invent Rust?
